# Weather APP with Vanilla TypeScript (using Vite) and API from [open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs)

### HTML Templates
- This tag has content which is hidden during page load that can later be rendered using `Javascript`.
- On `JS` end, we first clone the template using `content.cloneNode` function provided by TemplateElements which basically returns the HTMLElement(Node) contained inside element. We add the contents we want in this cloned element and append to our HTML. [Refer](src/main.ts#L58)
